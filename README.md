# ProjectGroup-22 : Decentralized voting app


1. Final Project Name: Decentralized voting app

2. Abstract
This application is to provide a decentralized voting mechanism where everyone has a fair role to play. It’s just like Blockchain mechanism. Nobody controls it and everyone is an owner and each vote is peer-peer verified. The voting system is 100% transparent, no central authority owning it, voters identification remain confidential. Also, people don’t have to leave their sofa to caste the vote but can do it at their convenience. 

It provides:
Anonymity of voters: ensures that whoever is casting a vote, they are authorized to do so. 
Single vote per person: No one would be able to vote more than once in the same election. 
Integrity of the voter: Ensures that vote given by the voter cannot be changed.

Since this application is decentralized, it ensures high availability and data security.
