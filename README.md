# ProjectGroup-22 : Decentralized voting app


1. Final Project Name: Decentralized voting app

2. Abstract

&nbsp;This application is to provide a decentralized voting mechanism where everyone has a fair role to play. It’s just like Blockchain mechanism. Nobody controls it and everyone is an owner and each vote is peer-peer verified. Given that every transaction that has been recorded on the blockchain has reached consensus on the network, no election fraud could happen. The voting system is 100% transparent, no central authority owning it, voters identification remain confidential. Also, people don’t have to leave their sofa to caste the vote but can do it at their convenience. 

It provides:
&nbsp;a. Anonymity of voters: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ensures that whoever is casting a vote, they are authorized to do so. \
&nbsp; b.Single vote per person: \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No one would be able to vote more than once in the same election. \
&nbsp;c. Integrity of the voter:\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ensures that vote given by the voter cannot be changed.\

Since this application is decentralized, it ensures high availability and data security.
