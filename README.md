# Project-22 : DeCent Vote 
 <p style="left:100px;"> - A Decentralized voting application </p>


<h1> <b> Decentralized voting application </b> </h1>

<br/>

<h1> <b> Abstract </b> </h1>

This application is to provide a web-based decentralised voting application where each and every voter has a fair role to play. It uses blockchain mechanism and prevents double-voting and fraudulent voting. In this application, each voter registers with valid details and then votes to the corresponding party. Each registered voter has a unique voter ID. A set of authentication keys is generated against each voter. When a user votes, it is checked whether it is the first time or it is already done before. And it is ensured that there can be utmost only one vote casted from each voter. After passing through this verification, the vote is then recorded as done. All votes that are accepted require consensus across the network. No single node controls it and every node is an owner and each vote is peer-peer verified. 

Given that every recorded vote on the blockchain needs consensus on the network and the fact that it is merely impossible to manipulate too many systems at the time, the chances of fraudulent votes are very low. The voting system is 100% transparent, no central authority owns it and the voters identification remains confidential. Also, people donâ€™t have to leave their sofa to cast their votes but they can do it online at their own convenience. Since this application is de-centralized, it ensures high availability and data security.

It provides:<br>
 a. Anonymity of voters: ensures that whoever is casting a vote, they are authorised to do so.<br>
 b. Only one vote per person: No one would be able to vote more than once in the same election.<br>
 c. Data integrity: Ensures that once voted, it cannot be manipulated.<br>
